# ANT GROUP CASE STUDY

## Overview and Origin

Ant Group, the payment- and finance-focused sister company of the Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba is the world's highest-valued FinTech

company, and most valuable unicorn (start-up) company, with a valuation of US$150 billion.

Ant Group is an innovative technology company that aims to bring inclusive benefits and sustainable services to the world. Formally

established in October 2014, Ant’s traces back its origins to 2004; when Alipay was created in the nascent days of e-commerce to solve the

trust issue between buyers and sellers in online transactions. This innovative payment solution bridged the trust gap, facilitated online 

transactions and underpinned the development of e-commerce in China. 

Having pioneered digital payments in China, they have since expanded its service offerings through technology and innovation to enable

digital finance for consumers and businesses.

* Name of company

On July 13, 2020, the Company’s name was changed to Ant Group Co., Ltd., formerly known as Zhejiang Ant Small and Micro Financial Services

Group Co., Ltd., 

* When was the company incorporated?

In Jul 2020 Ant Group, the parent company of Alipay, announced plans for a concurrent listing on Shanghai Stock Exchange's STAR market and

the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.

Just about a month after the announcement of a Shanghai and Hong Kong dual listing plan, Ant Group, the world’s most valuable startup, filed

its prospectus with the two cities’ bourses late Tuesday August 25, 2020.

On September 18, 2020  the Shanghai Stock Exchange announced that Ant Group had been approved by the listing committee. It only took 25 days

for the company from when it first filed for the prospectus to the approval from the Star Market now. Ant IPO may surpass Aramco’s US$29.4

billion IPO and become the world’s largest-ever fundraising.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Jack Yun MA , the lead founder, one of the directors and principal shareholders of Alibaba, and ultimate controller.

Joseph C. TSAI, one of the non-executive Directors and a founder, one of the directors and principal shareholders of Alibaba.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Online finance has exploded in China in recent years, and Ant’s flagship service, Alipay, has been a key driver. Relatively few people in

China had credit cards when e-retail and other internet services began taking off in the country. That has helped app-based payments become 

far more ubiquitous in China than they are in the West.

Ant’s origins date to 2004 when Alipay was created in the nascent days of e-commerce to solve the trust issue between buyers and sellers in

online transactions. Their innovative payment solution bridged the trust gap, facilitated online transactions and underpinned the 

development of e-commerce in China. Having pioneered digital payments in China, they have since expanded their service offerings through

technology and innovation to enable digital finance for consumers and businesses.

In China, $67 trillion in transactions were conducted on mobile devices in 2018, according to estimates by the research firm Bernstein. Many

of those took place through Alipay and WeChat, a rival digital wallet and messaging app owned by another Chinese internet giant, Tencent.

In 2008, Alipay was upgraded from a payment platform to a comprehensive convenience service platform through which people can pay utility 

bills for water, electricity, coal, communications, etc. Once people were using Alipay to stash their cash and pay for online purchases, Ant

could begin offering them other kinds of services through the app, including personal loans and insurance policies. Alipay says it has 900 

million users in China.

In order to meet the needs of more users, Ant Financial Co., Ltd. was officially established in 2014. With the mission of “bringing more 

equal opportunities for the world,” Ant Financial is committed to building an open and shared credit system and financial service platform

through technological innovation capabilities.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Liquidity and Capital Resources:

They have funded their cash requirements principally from cash generated from operating activities, funds raised through private placement 

and bank borrowings. They had cash and cash equivalents of RMB20,378 million, RMB46,000 million, RMB39,767 million and RMB71,413 million as

of December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and June 30, 2020, respectively. Going forward, they believe that their liquidity requirements will be

satisfied by using a combination of cash generated from operating activities, other funds raised from the capital markets and bank 

borrowings from time to time.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

While some countries, such as China and Sweden, have leapt ahead of the world in adoption of digital finance, huge parts of the developing

world still lack even the most basic of access to banking. According to a study by the World Bank in 2018, 1.7 billion adults globally 

remain unbanked, missing out on a crucial capability needed for them to escape a lifetime of poverty.

Ant Group mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere. The company was founded to champion the small and the underserved, in the

belief that its open technology platforms could help service providers and institutions to reach customers that previously were not 

accessible. They believe that concentrating on customers’ needs and solving their problems ultimately will lead to the best outcome for our 

business. Their decisions are guided by how they serve its mission over the long term, not by the pursuit of short-term gains.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Ant Group together with Alibaba, are building the infrastructure for commerce and services. They have created an ecosystem around its

platform that consists of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, third-party service providers, strategic alliance partners and other

businesses.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Time spent is a key metric for success in the app economy and for most categories it indicates the degree to which your customers are

engaged and receiving value from your app. This metric can be broken down into two key components, the amount of users an app has and how 

long each user spends using the app. It is critical to continuously monitor time spent in your app to see how it’s trending and compares to

your competitors.

Monthly Active Users (MAU), a commonly used metric to measure how many people engage with an app each month, which is the first part of the 

equation for calculating Total Time. Average Time Per User, the other key component of the Total Time equation.

Before its Initial Public Offering the company had an 8% market share compared to 14% of Paypal’s.
